# Samurai-Game

This Python program is a multiplayer medieval-themed game that uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, Pygame, and NumPy to create an interactive app that captures real-time input from the user's camera. It displays four windows: a live camera feed, a second window showing the user's pose structure as detected and rendered by MediaPipe's pose estimation model, a live camera feed of the second player that uses an IP camera, and a fourth window showing the user's pose structure as detected and rendered by MediaPipe's pose estimation model.
